## Introduction

This is a code repository for a covid-19 dashboard. This dashboard was created using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS

- Global and country specific cases, deaths, recoveries
- New daily cases, deaths recoveries

## Data Resources

[NovelCOVID API](https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API) API used for the data seen on this site

## Future Improvements

This app works well as it is now. But it's too plain and more can be improved. Here's a list of thing I might want to improve

- Using another color instead of plain white
- Adding "active cases" and "critical cases"
- Improving the chart
- Add a table to display data from countries
- Add searchbar to dropdown country list to optimize country selection
